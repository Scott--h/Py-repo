so this is gonna be a super alert program.
I wanna be able to track a stock and receive an alert
stock moves += X%
increases in volume

other stuff that I don't get with ameritrade:
watchlist information alongside actual balances (multiple categories of stocks)
text document with the names of the stocks I'm interested in following
potentially logging information in .csv files to
look at stock prices over the course of a day in 15-30 second intervals
